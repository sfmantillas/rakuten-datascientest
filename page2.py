            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Median: 11. The median of 11 informs us that the 50% of the products have designations shorter than 11 words, and similarly for titles with more than 11 words. </p>
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Mean: 11.56. The mean is slighly displaced to the right respect to the median due to the long tail for long titles, that is, the distribution is skewed to the right and rare long titles pull the mean to that direction. </p>
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Standard deviation: 6.21. The standard deviation of 6.21 tells us about the dispersion around the mean, and closely around the median, suggesting that the majority of the titles are approximately between 6 and 18 words.   </p>
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Skewness: 2.10. The positive skewness of 2.10 is consistent to the conclusions we extracted from the median and the mean, the distribution is skewed to the right, it means, there are rare titles with very long titles, some of them with four times more words than the median of 11. 
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Kurtosis: 7.60. Finally, the kurtosis of 7.60 is informing that the distribution is leptokurtic, that is, it has longer tails and is more peaked close to the mean compared to a normal distribution. In particular, this value larger than 3, reaffirms the existence of outliers and extreme values, it means, the very rare and long titles.  </p>

The number of words of the descriptions is considerably spread aroud the median, with the left side of the interval, that is, the mean minus one standard deviation, reaches negative values, suggesting that many products have descriptions with no words, that is, description is missing.   </p>
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Skewness: 3.11. The skewness reconfirms the conclusions when we observe the mean minus the median, that it is strongly right-skewed with rare very long descriptions. 
            - <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Kurtosis: 18.02. Lastly, the kurtosis of 18.02 shows that the distribution is more peaked and has much longer tails than a normal distribution.  </p>

            Theses observations are at the end consistent to the fact that 4886 products
            have no description. These observations led us to concatenate the designation
            and the description variables to obtain only one text variable that we will
            classify using machine-learning techniques, and lastly with deep neural 
            networks when images are included in the classification.

            Initial image analysis, shown through collages of 
            the first 200 products, reveals that certain 
            categories (e.g., pool equipment and cushions)
